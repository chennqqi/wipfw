Mirror of port of BSD ipfw firewall for windows

I was drunk when created that repo and have not any experience in creating Windows drivers or firewalls. But that firewal must exist. It is better than all that firewall bloatware  for windows ever existed.

TODO:

1) Make working 32 bit binary version for Windows 7.

2) Make working 64 bit binary version for Windows 7.

3) Make working 32 bit binary version for Windows 8.

4) Make working 64 bit binary version for Windows 8.

Fork, make commits. We still rememeber the vest firewall fro windows XP!
